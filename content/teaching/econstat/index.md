# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This course will introduce students to a core set of topics in statistics. The class will be composed of four areas of study: (1) describing, presenting and analyzing data; (2) probability theory, distributions (discrete and continuous), and random variables; (3) sampling theory, estimation and hypothesis testing; (4) linear regression analysis. The objectives of the course are to provide students with a practical knowledge of statistics in order to better understand current events and policy discussions; to introduce students to the data analysis, formal models and problem-solving methods used by statisticians and econometricians; to enable students to read and understand basic economic research that uses statistical methods; to prepare students for further study in econometrics; and to teach students how to use and perform statistical analysis using Stata â€“ a statistical package.

abstract: This course intends to expose you to the statistical techniques that economists use for estimating, testing, and forecasting economic relationships. The emphasis is on understanding the techniques involved and what they mean in terms of the economic problem being studied. Successful completion of this course should allow you to (1) understand empirical literature in economics and (2) be prepared to start doing independent research using economic data, particularly in upper-level classes. This course will emphasize economic applications over statistical theory. Through this course, you will have gained the skills necessary to be a thoughtful consumer of social science research. You will be able read and understand the output that is generated when you estimate a model. You will be able to identify and analyze the basic problems that can arise when using ordinary least squares estimation and you will be able to implement the appropriate techniques to overcome these problems. Students often find the course to be rigorous and demanding. We will move quickly and cover a large amount of material. I advise you to prepare for class and keep up with the material, as the course does not lend itself to memorization or all-night cram sessions.

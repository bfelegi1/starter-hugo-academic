abstract: "Despite the growing size of private-school voucher programs, our understanding of their effectiveness relies on results from small-scale randomized control trials. In this paper, we show that those results may not translate to programs at scale by examining changes in school quality following the implementation of the largest voucher program in the United States, the Indiana Choice Scholarship Program. We find that public schools facing high exposure to the policy increased their quality while participating private schools decreased their quality. Public schools with below-median baseline school value-added drive our results, suggesting that the gap in public school quality is shrinking because of the program. We explore these effects in a model of household demand for schools. We show that the incentive to provide quality is nonlinear. Voucher programs only threaten public school enrollment when the voucher amount is large or when a significant proportion of students are eligible to participate. Policymakers interested in adopting and expanding these programs should consider these indirect and nonlinear effects to understand vouchersâ€™ impact on educational outcomes."

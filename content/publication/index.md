summary: "We study the response of monthly U.S. dollar real exchange rates to global and country-specific temperature shocks and find substantial cross-sectional differences across country pairs. The real exchange rate is more likely to depreciate if the country is warmer, wealthier, more dependent on agriculture, less open, and more dependent on tourism."

abstract: "We find heterogeneous impulse responses of monthly U.S. dollar (USD) real exchange rates of 76 countries to global temperature shocks. Four years after a positive 1C increase in global temperature over its historical average, the Czech Republic currency appreciates by 14.5 percent against the USD while the currency of Burundi depreciates by 4.2 percent. The determinants of response heterogeneity are studied by regressing local projection response coefficients on country characteristics. A country's currency more likely to depreciate if it is of low latitude, if the country has grown faster, is richer, more dependent on agriculture and tourism, and is less open to trade."

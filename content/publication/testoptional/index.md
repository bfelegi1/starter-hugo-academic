abstract: As of 2019, about 250 four-year colleges and universities had adopted a test-optional application procedure that allowed students to apply for admission without submitting an SAT or ACT score. Many schools adopted this procedure to encourage greater racial and socioeconomic diversity among admitted students. Unfortunately, we know little about the impact of test- optional policies. In this paper, I use a difference-in-differences design to examine the impact of this reform on schools that adopted the policies between 2005 and 2014. Compared to schools that did not switch, test-optional schools witnessed an 18.2 log point increase in the number of minority enrollments and a 10.2 log point increase in the number of Pell Grant students. I also show that test-optional policies affect financial aid disbursements. After switching, schools experienced an increase in the number of students receiving institutional grant aid, but decreases in the average aid granted. Schools offset the decrease in grant aid by increasing the availability of institutional loans. These results take on heightened importance as nearly 800 additional four- year college and universities adopted these policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
